=============================

Generate a MANIFEST.SKIP file

= Synopsis

  use inc::Module::Install;

  all_from 'lib/Foo.pm';

  manifest_skip;

  WriteAll;

= Description

This module generates a `MANIFEST.SKIP` file for you (using
[Module::Manifest::Skip]) that contains the common files that people do not
want in their `MANIFEST` files. The SKIP file is generated each time that you
(the module author) run `Makefile.PL`.

You can add your own custom entries at the top of the `MANIFEST` file.  Just
put a blank line after your entries, and they will be left alone.

This module also adds 'MANIFEST' to the `clean_files()` list so that `make
clean` will remove your `MANIFEST`.

= Options

if you don't plan on adding anything to the stock MANIFEST.SKIP and just want
`make clean` to delete it, say this:

  manifest_skip 'clean';

= Theory

one school of thought for release management is that you never commit your
`MANIFEST` file. You just generate it using `make manifest`, right before
releasing a module, and then delete it afterwards.

This is good because you never forget to add new files to your `MANIFEST`.
The only problems are that you always need to generate a `MANIFEST.SKIP` file,
and you need to add `MANIFEST` to your clean_files, or delete it by hand. This
module does these things for you.
