=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use inc::Module::Install;

    all_from 'lib/Foo.pm';

    manifest_skip;

    WriteAll;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module generates a C<MANIFEST.SKIP> file for you (using
L<Module::Manifest::Skip>) that contains the common files that people do not
want in their C<MANIFEST> files. The SKIP file is generated each time that you
(the module author) run C<Makefile.PL>.

You can add your own custom entries at the top of the C<MANIFEST> file. Just
put a blank line after your entries, and they will be left alone.

This module also adds 'MANIFEST' to the C<clean_files()> list so that C<make
clean> will remove your C<MANIFEST>.

=head1 OPTIONS

if you don't plan on adding anything to the stock MANIFEST.SKIP and just want
C<make clean> to delete it, say this:

    manifest_skip 'clean';

=head1 THEORY

one school of thought for release management is that you never commit your
C<MANIFEST> file. You just generate it using C<make manifest>, right before
releasing a module, and then delete it afterwards.

This is good because you never forget to add new files to your C<MANIFEST>.
The only problems are that you always need to generate a C<MANIFEST.SKIP>
file, and you need to add C<MANIFEST> to your clean_files, or delete it by
hand. This module does these things for you.
